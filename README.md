The data set is on arteries harvested from patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery. The following links help to get an understanding of the data and what the variables mean.

The data provided relates to the 110 subjects from whom morphometric data on the internal thoracic artery and the radial artery could be obtained. They also had several other variables, as outlined in the information.

There are several important outcomes measured on the arteries; two are considered here, namely, radial artery (RA) medial calcification and internal thoracic artery (ITA) intimal abnormality.
The clients who carried out the study have thought about combining these two outcomes, which makes four groups (RA medial calcification: yes/no combined with ITA intimal abnormality yes/no).

The question is: How are the explanatory variables age, gender, diabetes, ever smoked, PVD and CVD related to this variable? Can you predict which of the four groups someone will be in, based on these variables and these data? Is there more than one way of doing this?
